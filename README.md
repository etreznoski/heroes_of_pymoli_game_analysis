## Based on the available data I have observed the following trends:

1. While female players tend to spend more per purchase, there are significantly more male players so male players contribute more to the overall purchase value. 

2. Young adults make the most purchases with the 20-24 year age group purchasing more than any other group.

3. The more popular items tend to be more profitable as well.
